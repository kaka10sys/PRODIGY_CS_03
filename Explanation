Here's how the program works:

The assess_password_strength function takes a password as input and assesses its strength based on various criteria, such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The function returns a tuple containing the password strength score (int) and a feedback message (str).
The main function provides a simple interface for the user to enter a password to assess.
The program then calls the assess_password_strength function with the entered password and prints the resulting password strength score and feedback message.
